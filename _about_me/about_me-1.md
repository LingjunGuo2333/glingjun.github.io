I was born in a small town in Sichuan Province, China. You probably head about 'Sichuan' for its good food. Unfortunately, many places are 'heard about' for their good food so that it's hard for one to tell whether people actually heard about it or just don't know about it, but how could it be wrong to compliment on good food! Everyone likes good food, except guys with eating disorders. Anyway, allow me to assume you didn't hear about it so that we are on the same page. Like most cities in Sichuan, spicy food is popular in my hometown.

I like movies and games. I mainly play WarThuder. I also like planes for their elegent trajectories in the sky. I always dream that one day I will be able to fly a plane. I'm not really a sportive person. My favoriate sports is body building because I enjoy the happiness and exciteness brought by lifting heavy items. I also like swimming and other activities that involves playing with water.
