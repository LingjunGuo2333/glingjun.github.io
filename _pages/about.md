Hi there, welcome to my homepage! I wish to share my academic and personal interests with you here!

I'm a second year master student @[UMIOE](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/), where I have taken courses focused on theoretical side of optimization. I was also fortunate enough to join into Prof.[Salar Fattahi](https://fattahi.engin.umich.edu/)'s research group working on basis function decomposition for deep neural networks. Prior to that, I recieved my B.S. degree in [Mathematics and Applied Mathematics](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/) in Fudan University, China.
